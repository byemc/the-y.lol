# Site redesign... part 3 ðŸ˜”

*Update 1 Feb 2022: made images clickable for full size images*

***UPDATE 2023-01-21:** Marked obsolete*

Hi there! I thought I might give you guys an update on how the site's coming along.

GitHub scrapers might notice that [yesterday's post](2022/01/better-site-design-still-still-working-on-it-lol) was [committed today](https://github.com/byemc/byemc.github.io/commit/f33bdc455cf0abd91d7acc6adbf5d4cf90c3fb2e). Yeah... haha, I forgot to publish my changes lol.

Anyways, let's go over today's changelog... (or yesterday's, but anyway).

Firstly, I fixed an annoying issue with the image being taller than the `div` and overflowing into the next post listing. (this stopped me from [redoing the post list design](https://github.com/byemc/byemc.github.io/commit/f33bdc455cf0abd91d7acc6adbf5d4cf90c3fb2e) lol)

I also made it look slightly better on mobile...

and remade the article page... in exactly the same way.

Anyways, that's it for today! Make sure to come back tomorrow for... hopfully a better design and i can finally finish doing this lol
