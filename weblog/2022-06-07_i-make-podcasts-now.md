Hi there! My name is Bye. If you've been following [my socials](https://bye.omg.lol) recently, you'll have noticed that I now own a domain called [`byecasts.com`](https://byecasts.com/), and a Twitter account by the handle [@reviewmygame](https://twitter.com/reviewmygame). Well, the thing is, I want to be a podcaster.

So, I thought up of a thing I want to do. After setting on reviewing games, I came up - randomly - with *Review My Game*. I slapped together a quick trailer and sent it off to the podcasting platforms. Once I actually make content, it'll be posted on `byecasts.com` first, but for you guys I'll make sure to send the first episode along here too.

You can follow *Review My Game* on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/50GteIbJ6EIcnrpSSGFrOA?si=2d5a3f2acad544ef) and [Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/review-my-game/id1621876631?itsct=podcast_box_badge&itscg=30200&ls=1). I'd appreciate it if you did! When the first episode drops, don't be afraid to [email me](reviewmygame@byemc.xyz) your criticisms, or just leave a rating if your podcasting service allows it!
