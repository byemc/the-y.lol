Hi guys, welcome back to my (terrible) blog. 

I've worked out fonts.

The main font for this site it called *[Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Atkinson+Hyperlegible)*. I like it because it looks good (in my opinion), and it's also <abbr title="accessibility">a11y</abbr> friendly.

Today, I decided to venture out, and using more fonts.

(Note: you mightn't see the font changes if you use reader mode.)

The font for the details at the top is now *[Roboto Slab](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Slab?sort=popularity)*, or a different `serif` font if that doesn't work. I've put an example picture at the bottom for [reader mode/RSS] readers

The body font is still Atkinson Hyperlegible, and monospace (e.g. codeblocks) fonts are now *[Space Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Space+Mono?sort=popularity)

You can see the progress later... when I use these more often. 

Anyway, that's it for today... next time i'm adding code highlighting + actual table styling (finally.)
