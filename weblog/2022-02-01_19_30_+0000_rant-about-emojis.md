Unfortunately, this is a rant.

I like the look of `Apple Color Emojis`, the emojis found in iOS and macOS.

I also like the look of Google's Blob design from a few years back, which has been updated by the community in a fork of Google's `Noto Emoji` font, called [`Blobmoji`](https://github.com/C1710/blobmoji).

I'm *also* a fan of the new Windows 11 emojis, while they aren't what was promised, it's still good that they gave the design a refresh.

The thing is, I don't know what to use for this site!

I *could* just use the default based on the system but...

I'll try alternating between them over the next few days.

Or....

I don't know. I'll have it set to Blobmoji for now, but my mind'll change

This was a lazy post, i know.
