I've decided to learn node.js.

I've been needing an excuse to move away from Python and learn something else (nothing against it but it's time to learn more!). Turns out learning web development is the way to go... considering I'm currently building my own site. (idk i might make games in c# once im finished this)

Anyway, I thought I might as well share my progress and certain failure.

This isn't gonna be daily btw
