# Site redesign!! (still working on it lol)

***UPDATE 2022-11-12:** Updated email address during migration.*

***UPDATE 2023-01-21:** This post is now obsolete.*

Hi there! You might've noticed that this site is going through a few changes, such as abandoning [Tumblr](https://byemc.tumblr.com) for [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). But I'm not migrating again! I'm starting fresh!

Now the site respects dark mode (defaults to light mode if no preference), and will soon have a mobile design. I'm also planning on putting more projects here, so look for a "Projects" tab in the top!

Anyways, if you'd like to tell me how I'm doing, just [drop me an email](mailto:bye@byecorps.com) with your feedback. The site is still a work in progress. I'm working on it! Stay tuned.
