# just dance is eating my soul

this is a draft, go away

Recently, I got an Apple Watch. After breaking the included strap while figuring out how to attach it, I looked through the Workouts app and found “Dance” was a workout… and of course my brain remembers how I have a copy of Just Dance. Needless to say, I don’t regret picking up that Joy-Con, putting in my cartridge of *Just Dance 2018* and started a jam session of a whopping three songs, as I wasn’t paying for Just Dance Unlimited. Two of these were in Japanese: [Love Ward by Oster Project (credited as Hatsune Miku)](https://youtu.be/tPnIwDBk09k) and [Sayonara by Wanko Ni Mero Mero](https://song.link/i/1595924665). Keep that second song in mind, as I have a tangent related to it and about 65 others. I’ll get back to it later.
